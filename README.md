# RemediationMetaGenome
Metagenomic analysis of contaminated environments
I downloaded three metagenomic datasets from the GEO repository on GenBank:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38004,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE24353, 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55293

These data are from environments contminated with hydrocarbons from different industrial processes.
I wanted to see if there was metabolic activity associated with hydrocarbon degradation and if so could 
full metabolic pathways be constructed from that data that would result in the decomposition of the more
toxic compunds in anaerobic and/or aerobic conditions. 
I am submitting some of my results and visulizations with the code I used.
